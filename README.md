# Data_Analysis

In this Python-based data analysis project, I employed the capabilities of NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib to dissect an IPL dataset. Using Pandas for data preprocessing and manipulation, along with NumPy for numerical computations, I uncovered insightful patterns, while Matplotlib facilitated the creation of visualizations that highlighted player performance, team dynamics, and match trends.
